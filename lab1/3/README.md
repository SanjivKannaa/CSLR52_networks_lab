##AIM
Send datagrams with two arrays of integers (only even numbers) to a server. The server should check the data, whether there are odd and/or fraction numbers. If it is not, the server sums the elements of each array and puts the sum in a third array that is returned to the client. If the server discovers that the arrays have erroneous then the server does not reply. A timeout period should be established by the client such that retransmission occurs after the period expires.
