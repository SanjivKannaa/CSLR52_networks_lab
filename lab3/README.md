Implement any 2 out of the 3 given below
1) Implement an auction marketplace. An auctioneer has a set of items to be auctioned and users can buy an item. Before an item is sold, it should be properly put out for auction - the auctioneer starts with the basic price, and users keep quoting higher and higher prices till no one agrees for a higher price and one of them decides to buy it.

2) Implement an auth service using sockets. Clients can create / sign up an account.  Once signed in, you can store key value pairs which you can return as per demand. Implement some form of hashing of password and encryption for kay value paid using a library. Also allow clients to login and upload files in the server and set proper access - either to the whole public or only to certain specific users.

3) Design a program using socket programming that implements the hexapawn game. It is a mini-version of chess. It is played on a 3x3 board. The goal of each player is to either advance a pawn to the opposite end of the board or leave the other player with no legal moves, either by stalemate or by having all of their pieces captured. Write appropriate server and client programs for the game and simulate the game playing.
