Simulate any 3 topologies (of which one must be hybrid topology) with N nodes for 100secs. The nodes are numbered sequentially started from 1. In all the topologies, the odd numbered stations are sources and even numbered nodes are destinations. Assume that all source nodes transmit the fixed size data packets from the starting of the simulation till the end of the simulation.  

Plot 
    Graph1: Throughput in Y-axis vs No. of nodes (5,10,15,20, 25) in X-axis
    Graph2: Packet Loss in Y-axis vs No. of nodes (5,10,15,20, 25) in X-axis

Assume your own values for the rest of the parameters.
